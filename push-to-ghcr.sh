# Push container images to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
#
# WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS:
# After building containers locally, you often want to share them with others or use them
# in production. GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) is a free service that stores your
# container images and makes them available to anyone (or just your team, if private).
#
# TWO DIFFERENT MODES:
# 1. DEFAULT MODE: Push existing local images (built with build-all.sh or build-container.sh)
#    - Uses the platform-specific images like "full-container-arm64"
#    - Each image only works on its specific architecture
#
# 2. MULTI-PLATFORM MODE (-a flag): Build and push multi-platform images
#    - Creates images that work on both arm64 AND amd64 automatically
#    - Docker automatically downloads the right version for each user's architecture
#    - Can't be stored locally - must be pushed directly to registry
#
# AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED:
# Before using this script, you must login to GitHub Container Registry:
#   docker login ghcr.io
# Use your GitHub username and a Personal Access Token (not your password)

set -e  # Exit if any command fails

# Configuration - these variables control where images are pushed
# WHY WE USE VARIABLES: This makes it easy to change settings without editing the whole script
REGISTRY="ghcr.io"  # GitHub Container Registry URL
# Auto-detect repository owner from environment (works in GitHub Actions) or default to jbearak

Usage: $0 [OPTIONS]

Push Docker images to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

OPTIONS:
    -t, --target TARGET     Push specific target only (default: push all targets)
                           Available targets: full-container, r-container
    -g, --tag TAG          Tag for the image (default: $DEFAULT_TAG)
    -b, --build            Build the image before pushing
    -f, --force            Force push even if image doesn't exist locally
    -a, --all-platforms    Build and push multi-platform images (linux/amd64,linux/arm64)
    -h, --help             Show this help message

EXAMPLES:
    $0                                         # Push all targets (host platform only)
    $0 -a                                      # Build and push all targets (both platforms)
    $0 -t full-container                       # Push only full-container (host platform)
    $0 -a -t full-container                    # Build and push full-container (both platforms)
    $0 -t r-container -g v1.0.0              # Push only r-container:v1.0.0 (host platform)
    $0 -b                                     # Build and push all targets (host platform)
    $0 -a -b                                  # Build and push all targets (both platforms)

PREREQUISITES:
    1. Docker must be installed and running
    2. You must be logged in to GHCR: docker login ghcr.io
    3. You must have push permissions to the repository
    4. For multi-platform builds: docker buildx with multi-platform support
